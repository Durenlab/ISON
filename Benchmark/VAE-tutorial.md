## Running `vae.py`

To run the `vae.py` file, make sure that both the **1st VAE** (bemodel) and **2nd VAE** model (model2) files are available.

The trained models are stored at the following Google Drive link:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15u2P7VvW_ThcgaK1FFHBXYvj2AxtaR8M?usp=share_link

Download the models from this folder and place them in the appropriate directory as expected by `vae.py` before execution.
